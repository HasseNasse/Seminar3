# The-Dining-Philosophers-Erlang
This is a implementation of The Dining Philosophers in Erlang.
The application is created to show what the behaviour of 5 philosophers are when put in a situation that they only have 5 chopsticks to eat
with and they cycle between being awake(wanting to eat) and asleep.
